What Happens when we type url in broswer and hit enter

Parse the url
  1) The url will be parsed first
  2) Broswer will try to extract domain and protocol
  3) protocol will be http: Hyper Text Transfer protocol
  4) Resource "/" : Retrive main page
  5) When no valid protocol or domain name is entered then the typed data will be passed
     to browser default search engines

Check HSTS list
  1) The broswer then check its "preloaded HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) list
  2) This includes the list of websites to be contacted via HTTPS only
  3) If the website is not in list a send normal HTTP or if it exists send HTTPS
  4) Its possible to send initial request as http and user can switch to https depending upon
  5) However there is a possiblity of downgrade attack so modern broswers have this lookup


DNS lookup
  1) The Broswer tries to find the IP of the domain . It happens in following sequence
  2) Broswer cache
  3) OS cache (if broswer cache dont have then go to OS cache)
  4) Router cache (if OS dont have then move to router)
  5) ISP DNS cache (if not found in router cache)
  6) Recursive search (ISP DNS tries for recursive search from root nameserver,through .com top level nameserver,to google nameserver)


Opening of a socket & TLS handshake

  1) After receiving IP address and it make TCP socket stream call using system lib for specific port 
  2) Port can be 80 for http and 443 for https
  3) Client send a request for TCP request and server respond with certificate and encrytion type for HTTPS
  4) Client verfies and sends back ack and also three way handshake is established
  5) If valid HTTPS procedure is done then client send the details using encrypted channel


After successful TCP protocol established then file transfer begins depending upon client request
(Note depending on client and browser agreement HTTP1.1 or HTTP2 is used to communication)
